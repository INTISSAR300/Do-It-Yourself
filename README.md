# Do-It-Yourself
The goal: The idea is to create a management platform for DIY (Do It Yourself) workshops, where users can register, view workshops (e.g., painting, crafting, cooking, etc.), book spots for these workshops, and manage their bookings. This platform is composed of several services to efficiently organize information and actions.
